      <div className="title">That Time I Took a Hard Plunge into Depression, but Found Myself</div>
      <p>To say my childhood was a bit unpredictable would be an understatement.
        I didn’t have much stability, not enough guidance, and felt like there was a definite lack in the love department.
        However, God works in mysterious ways.
        I met my husband when we were both teenagers.</p>
      
      <p>I was fresh out of a bad situation.
        Sparks flew, we immediately hit it off and began to build a life together.
        Fast forward a good amount of years, and we’ve built the life of our dreams.
        We’ve got two kids, a dog, and a happy marriage….
        Next up?</p>
        
      <p>A house, and a better paying job.
        We wanted to move out of town, not that far, but far enough for more opportunities and better schools.
        We moved and I started looking for a new job shortly after.
        I found one somewhat quickly.
        The pay was something nobody could pass up, but I wanted to.</p>
        
        <p>I hated the idea of the job, it didn’t seem like something I’d want, but it being so close to home and so much more money I felt obligated to do it for my family.
        I should have waited, left when I felt more comfortable.
        I should have been more honest about my feelings, but I didn’t feel like I could, that felt selfish.
        I took the job, gave a long notice to my current job since I had been there a while, and almost immediately fell into a depression.
        It started with middle-of-the-night panic attacks, begging my husband to stay home from work.</p>
        
        <p>It escalated to me literally hitting my knees every morning when I woke up because standing was just too hard.
        I stopped talking, eating, stopped enjoying everything I had ever enjoyed.
        I actually remember there was a point where I saw people laughing, and realized that I forgot what it felt like to be happy.
        All my smiles were fake, but I smiled anyway.
        I never let my kids see it, and I still have no idea how I succeeded in that.</p>
        
        <p>My husband noticed, he knew how hard it was.
        However, he also knew how strong I really was, and encouraged me to push through, to keep with the plan, one day I’d be happy I did and he knew that.
        Crazy thing is that all this was happening while I was still working the same job, I hadn’t even left yet!
        I finally left the only stability I had ever known.
        A job I worked at for several years, and the most stable home I had ever had.</p>
        
        <p>I didn’t realize until then that the house I lived in with my husband was the longest I’d ever lived anywhere consistently.
        I couldn’t pull out of it, the new job was awful, I lasted a month.
        That’s not like me, I didn’t know me anymore.
        I quit and stayed home for a few months, I regrouped and I found another job.
        I was happier, still not completely whole again, but building up to that.</p>
        <p>The job was fine, but it wasn’t my end game.

        Out of nowhere one day, an opportunity fell into my lap while at work.
        I didn’t have to search, would have never thought to look in that direction anyway. It just appeared.
        There was God, working.
        I took it, I was excited about it, and I’ve never looked back.
        I reconnected with old friends, learned so much, and I’m happier than I’ve ever been.</p>
        
        <p>I will be forever grateful for that leap of faith, my supportive husband, and my strong will.
        I feel like somehow, this was me conquering any fears that were deeply rooted in my childhood.
        This was me finding myself, feeling stronger than ever, and realizing that I’d never be that scared of anything again.
        With prayers, love, and support, we can conquer anything.
        “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”</p>
